### Introduction

This is a simple interactive histogram that allows you to define two levels and see the
confidence that the mean for each bar lies in between these levels. As you hover over the 
plot, a horizontal line appears. Using these lines, you can define two levels. The color 
of the bars change depending on the confidence that the mean for each bar lies in between 
these levels.
